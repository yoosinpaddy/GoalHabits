# GoalHabits

The aim is to develop an application that helps you track goals by breaking them down into small steps and help you monitor them to enhance skills and achievements. 

## Functionalities
##### Goal Setting:
Users can create specific goals, naming each one.
For each goal, users can outline steps required for achievement.
##### Step Types:
Steps can be categorized as either daily routines or one-time events.
One-time events require set deadlines, while routines necessitate specified times, which can be daily, weekly, monthly, every business day, or twice a week.
##### Accountability:
Users commit to accountability by logging into the application each evening.
A checklist allows users to track daily accomplishments.
Reminders for specific events are set during goal or step creation.
##### Measurement and Reporting:
Accomplishments are measured and reported at the end of the week or month.
Reports can be generated and printed as PDFs.
##### Adaptive Scheduling:
If a user fails to achieve a goal at the set time, the application prompts them to reschedule or deem it irrelevant.
Users periodically confirm whether events contribute to their overall goals, especially after completing specific daily routines.
##### Multimedia Accountability:
Users can mark an event as achieved, attaching pictures as evidence.
Feedback options include written notes, voice recordings, or images.
Periodic slide creation showcases users' progress through a series of pictures.
##### Check-In Mechanism:
Daily or weekly check-ins prompt users to mark achieved goals and reschedule unmet ones.
Unfulfilled tasks marked as a fail cannot be postponed.
